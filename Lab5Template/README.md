# Task 1
### Inspecting power differences of operations

Replace the following 3 screenshots. First screenshot should contain a picture of a power trace where you are executing nothing but 30 lines of of asm mul.

Second should contain a screenshot of a power trace where you execute nothing but 30 lines of asm nop.

Third should contain your custom power trace where you execute any amount of nops AND muls. You need to execute atleast 10 lines worth of each command and in total atleast 40 lines worth of assembly code. You are not required to execute the commands in 10 line chuncks and you can execute also any other assembly commands besides nop and mul.

Please have your screenshots roughly in the same scale as the placeholders. If your whole trace doesn't fit to that scale then you can of course take a larger picture.

Remember also add textual descriptions of images if they are needed.

#### Three blocks of asm mul operations
