# **Answer template for Computer security lab 1: Fuzzing**

Fill in your answers to this template, answer every question. If screenshots are required, add them to "img" folder. Example of how to add images can be seen at the end of task 2.

If your own code is required, you can paste it to this document or create a "src" folder and add your code there.

You can remove all possible helper texts/questions if you want.

## **Task 5** 

### Contribute to a existing open-source project. Set up a fuzzer and report whole process and possible findings.

*You can fill your task 5 here, or make additional folder for it, since answer( or more likely a report) is expected to contain a lot of details.*
