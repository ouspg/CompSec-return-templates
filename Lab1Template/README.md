# **Answer template for Computer security lab 1: Fuzzing**

Fill in your answers to this template, answer every question. If screenshots are required, add them to "img" folder. Example of how to add images can be seen at the end of task 2.

If your own code is required, you can paste it to this document or create a "src" folder and add your code there.

You can remove all possible helper texts/questions if you want.
