## What is this repository for?



This repository is meant for returning all of the tasks, what you are doing in labs. Additionally final coursework can be returned here.

The actual instructions for tasks are [here.](https://github.com/ouspg/CompSec)

You will update and add all of your work on laboratory exercises into this repository during the course.


## How to proceed?

For each lab, you have to choose:
 * Take the weekly exam in Moodle.
 * Make the lab assignment, add your answers here and return link to this repository in Moodle. Max. grade is five (5).

 OR

 * Only take the weekly exam in Moodle. Max. grade is one (1).


There is corresponding template for each laboratory exercise in this repository.

There is template for text (README.md) in each template folder. You can remove all the questions if you want, as long as you are saving task numbers.

You can create folder named *src* for possible source code in each folder.

You can create folder named *img* for possible images/screenshots in each folder.

It is recommended to do as described above, but it is not required (= you can add more things if you like).


*If you are taking only weekly exams instead of corresponding lab, you don't have to fill this template.*


Check [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) if you need a refresher on how to use Git. Some basic commands below  
```git
git add </path/filename>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

If you have barely edited Markdown files, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free software for editing and showing live preview of it. It works on Windows, Linux and Mac. It is also installed to most of the virtual machines. For help with Markdown syntax, check [Example.md](Example.md)
## When to proceed?

There is a deadline for each lab.

When you have done the exercises of corresponding lab, you have to return link (URL) of this repository into [Moodle](https://moodle.oulu.fi) into corresponding returning box ***before deadline*** on Monday.

If you reach at least 3 points/level by that deadline, you may submit your work to return box and ask for extra time to do more difficult tasks if you think that given time is not enough for more challenging tasks.

In that case your work is attempted to be graded ASAP on Tuesday and if it is sufficient you will be given short feedback and extended deadline (same week Thursday). This offers possibility for improvements as well!

Note: You can return link beforehand and edit corresponding lab still here, as long as it has been done before deadline.

In practise, if you have done all of the six (6) labs, you return this same link six (6) times for different return boxes.

This is because:

 * We can track, if you have done the corresponding lab in each time. We know that there is something to review.

 * We can link correct person to correct repository (= We know, who has actually edited this repository)

 * There are people, who might only take weekly exams or some mix of
 both (labs today, but only exam next week). This way we know, if everybody has done something.

 * Private GitHub repositories can be more accessible than one hundred zip files.

 If you want to make ChipWhisperer lab beforehand (and it is recommended), *you can borrow the device, but it must be returned before actual lab. We need devices there.* Afterwards, devices can be borrowed again.

 Just take care that you have returned link before deadline, and corresponding lab of deadline has been completed here.
